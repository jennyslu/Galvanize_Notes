# MORNING
 -  SQL is declarative vs. Python is procedural
 -  To open Postgres: psql [name of database]
 -  _\d_ or _\dt_
  *  shows all tables
 -  _\d [table name]_
  *  shows schema for table
 -  _\d+ [table name]_
  *  shows more detailed schema for table
 -  _\list_
  *  shows all databases in Postgres
 -  _\connect [database name]_
  *  connect to that database
 -  *q*
  *  to quit scrolling

 ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM [table name] LIMIT 10;
 ```
 -  _Aggregates_ take multiple rows and return a single value; typically used in conjuction with GROUPBY

 ```SQL
    SELECT MIN(dt), MAX(dt), FROM visits;
 ```
   - there is a datetime type in Postgres - you can compare it to a string and the string will automatically convert the string to dat object
 ```SQL
    SELECT * FROM visits WHERE dt='2013-01-1';
 ```
 ```SQL
    SELECT DISTINCT date_part('month', dt)
    FROM visits
```

 ```SQL
    SELECT date_part('month', dt)
    FROM visits WHERE date_part('month', dt) = 1;
```
```SQL
    SELECT MIN(dt), MAX(dt), COUNT(1)
    FROM visits
    GROUP BY date_part('month', dt)
    ORDER BY date_part('month', dt);
```
 - COUNT(1) vs COUNT(\*)
  * COUNT(\*) counts all rows, COUNT(1) appends a column that just has 1's in it and counts how many 1's you created

 ```SQL
    SELECT date_part('month', dt) AS month, COUNT(1)
    FROM visits
    GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1;
```
 - could also GROUP BY month ORDER BY month. Number is for column number, i.e. GROUP BY 1 means GROUP BY first column.

 ```SQL
     SELECT *
        FROM(
            SELECT
                date_part('month', dt) AS month,
                COUNT(1) AS cnt
            FROM visits
            GROUP BY 1) a;
```
```SQL
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    JOIN events
    ON events.userid = users.userid;
```
 - This is an _inner_ join - this is the default JOIN option. There are also:
  * _left outer join, right outer join_ (kind of useless), _outer join_
 - You can also name the joined table using AS to be new_table
```SQL
    CREATE TABLE new_table AS
    SELECT *
    FROM users
    JOIN eventsON events.userid=users.userid;
```

# MORNING BREAKOUT
 - Order of SQL commands?
  * FROM user a - _open up first table_
  * JOIN event b ON a.userid = b.userid - _get all data_
  * WHERE - _filter rows out you don't want to look at_
  * GROUP BY - _group by for count/aggregation_
  * COUNT - _aggregate_
  * HAVING - _filter newly made aggregate column_
  * ORDER BY - _can technically order by columns not selected_
  * SELECT - _select columns you want to look at_

# AFTERNOON

 - Schema for table is set at time of table creation
  * Column names and types
  * Primary keys must be unique and not null. They are used as index which helps give constant time efficiency for look up
  * Foreign keys
 - From our previous exercises:

| events   |    meals     |    users |
| ---------|--------------|----------|
| userid = FK | meal_id = PK | userid = PK |
| meal_id = FK |             |             |

 - Get the average price, min price, max price for each meal type for meals in the first quarter of 2013

 ```SQL
 SELECT
    type,
    AVG(price),
    MIN(price),
    MAX(price)
FROM meals
WHERE
    date_part('month', dt) <= 3 AND
    date_part('year', dt) = 2013;
GROUP BY type;
 ```

 - Which user from each campaign bought the most items?
  * Begin by creating table with number of items each user bought
  * Grouping by campaign_id must be done because it was selected along with aggregate function. This shouldn't change our counts though because we're assuming that each user comes from only one single campaign.

```SQL
CREATE TABLE user_campaign_counts AS
SELECT
    users.userid,
    COUNT(*) as cnt,
    users.campaign_id
FROM events
JOIN users
ON events.userid = users.userid
WHERE event = 'bought'
GROUP BY users.userid, campaign_id;
```
```SQL
SELECT
    u.userid,
    u.campaign_id,
    u.cnt
FROM user_campaign_counts as u
JOIN (
    SELECT campaign_id, MAX(cnt) as max
    FROM user_campaign_counts
    GROUP BY campaign_id) m
ON
    u.cnt = m.max AND
    u.cnt = m.max;
```

|userid | campaign_id | cnt|
|--------|-------------|-----|
|    75 | RE          |  77 |
|   129 | PI          | 101 |
|    50 | FB          |  89 |
|    28 | TW          |  87 |
(4 rows)

# AFTERNOON BREAKOUT

 - FOREIGN KEY: which columns within this table is a foreign key that references another table?
 - REFERENCED BY: what columns in other tables depend on values in this table for their foreign key constraints?
